    aboutUs: "At Close, we're building the sales communication platform of the future. With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry toward eliminating manual processes and helping companies to close more deals (faster). Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of ~33 high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love.\n" +
      "Our app’s frontend is a single-page JavaScript web app mostly written in React (originally built with Backbone.js). We bundle with Webpack and target only modern browsers. We test with Enzyme and Mocha run via Puppeteer. Our UI updates in near real-time and is written in LESS/CSS (with flexbox and grid layout) using BEM methodology and takes advantage of fun technologies like Websockets and WebRTC. \n" +
      "We care about performance (e.g. route-based code splitting), maintainability, and testability of our frontend code. We sweat the UI/UX details and work collaboratively with the Product team throughout the design process. This means diving into lo-fi Freehand wireframes, and communicating continuously when those ideas are brought to life using Sketch/Abstract and code.\n" +
      "Our frontend app is built on top of our REST API & GraphQL endpoints. Our backend tech stack consists of Python/Flask, MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis. We run our services in Docker on AWS. We ❤ open source – using dozens of open source projects with contributions to many of them, and released some of our own like Microphone Recorder to Mp3, filevalidator.js, addresscompiler, backbone.mousetrapand more at https://github.com/closeio."
